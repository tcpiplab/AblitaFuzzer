When the Sun's light enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and particles in the air, such as nitrogen and oxygen. These particles scatter shorter wavelengths of light, which include blue and violet hues, more than other colors.\\n\\nHowever, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light, so we perceive the sky as appearing blue rather than violet. Additionally, some pollution and dust can scatter light in various directions, which can change the apparent color of the sky from a pure blue to a white or hazy appearance.\\n\\nThis phenomenon is more pronounced during sunrise and sunset when the sun's rays have to travel through more of Earth's atmosphere, causing the sky to display vivid shades of red, orange, and pink in addition to the blue hues.\"},\n",
