## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately by creating a private security advisory through GitHub's security reporting feature. Do not open a public issue for security-related concerns.

You can expect an initial response within 48 hours of your report. I will provide regular updates on the status of your report at least once per week until the issue is resolved or declined.

If the vulnerability is accepted, I will work to address it promptly and coordinate with you on disclosure timing. If declined, I will provide a clear explanation of the reasoning behind that decision.

For questions about this security policy, you can contact me directly through GitHub.
