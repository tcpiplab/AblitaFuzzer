### Installation, setup, and usage

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tcpiplab/AblitaFuzzer.git
cd AblitaFuzzer
```

#### Set up a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv AblitaFuzzer_venv
source AblitaFuzzer_venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install the required packages

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, depending on your OS...

```bash
python3 -m pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure local hostnames (optional, for lab scenarios)

AblitaFuzzer uses custom local hostnames to improve configuration flexibility. Add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
# Setup for ablitafuzzer.py config
127.0.0.1   api.target.local
127.0.0.1   burp.proxy.local
127.0.0.1   api.promptmaker.local
127.0.0.1   api.analyzer.local
```

These hostnames allow you to easily distinguish between different API endpoints in the configuration and make it 
simpler to modify individual endpoints without hunting through hardcoded IP addresses. These hostnames also make it 
easier to understand the role and functionality of each API endpoint or hostname mentioned in the source code as 
well as in the output of running the AblitaFuzzer tool. And of course they make it all less confusing when you are 
testing everything on localhost in a lab environment.

#### Set up Ollama for Unified Architecture

AblitaFuzzer now uses a unified Ollama architecture supporting both local and cloud deployments:

**Local Ollama Setup (for attack generation):**
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on your system
- Download an [abliterated](https://huggingface.co/collections/failspy/abliterated-v3-664a8ad0db255eefa7d0012b) model:
  ```bash
  ollama pull huihui_ai/granite3.2-abliterated:8b
  ```
- Start Ollama server (typically runs on `http://localhost:11434`)

**Target LLM Configuration:**
- **Local Testing**: Use another Ollama model as a target for testing
- **Cloud Testing**: Configure Ollama Cloud API credentials for production testing
- **Remote APIs**: Point to your client's LLM API endpoint

#### Configure API Settings

AblitaFuzzer uses a centralized configuration system. The default configuration in `configs/config.py` includes:

```python
'legacy_target': {
    'type': 'ollama',
    'base_url': 'https://ollama.com/api/chat',  # Ollama Cloud
    'auth': {'type': 'api_key', 'header': 'Authorization', 'format': 'Bearer ${OLLAMA_TURBO_API_KEY}'},
    'models': ['gpt-oss:120b']
},
'legacy_attacker': {
    'type': 'ollama', 
    'base_url': 'http://api.promptmaker.local:11434/v1',  # Local Ollama
    'auth': {'type': 'none'},
    'models': ['huihui_ai/granite3.2-abliterated:8b']
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- Set `OLLAMA_TURBO_API_KEY` for Ollama Cloud access
- Configure proxy settings via `http_proxy` environment variable if needed

#### Test calling both API URLs

```bash
python3 ablitafuzzer.py test
```

Or, if proxying through Burp or Zap:

```bash
python3 ablitafuzzer.py test --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### Run the fuzzer

```bash
python3 ablitafuzzer.py fuzz
```

Or, if proxying through Burp or Zap:

```bash
python3 ablitafuzzer.py fuzz --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### Dataset Management

AblitaFuzzer now includes an integrated dataset management system that downloads and caches research datasets automatically:

```bash
# List available datasets
python3 ablitafuzzer.py datasets list

# Get detailed information about a dataset
python3 ablitafuzzer.py datasets info advbench_harmful

# Download a specific dataset
python3 ablitafuzzer.py datasets download advbench_harmful

# Check cache status
python3 ablitafuzzer.py cache status

# Clear cache (optional dataset name)
python3 ablitafuzzer.py cache clear [dataset_name]
```

The tool automatically downloads and caches datasets from established research sources like AdvBench when needed. Datasets are cached locally in `~/.ablitafuzzer/cache/` to avoid repeated downloads.

### ðŸŽ¯ Professional Analysis & Reporting

AblitaFuzzer now includes a comprehensive professional analysis and reporting engine:

#### Generate Professional Security Assessment Reports

```bash
# Generate comprehensive executive and technical reports
python3 ablitafuzzer.py report generate --target-name "Production API" --criticality high --compliance SOC2 ISO27001

# Export results in multiple formats
python3 ablitafuzzer.py report export json --output security_assessment.json
python3 ablitafuzzer.py report export csv --output vulnerabilities.csv

# Run enhanced NLP classification with professional analysis
python3 ablitafuzzer.py analysis classify --generate-report
```

#### Legacy Analysis (still available)

```bash
python3 ablitafuzzer.py analyze
```

#### Professional Report Features

- **Executive Reports**: Business-focused summaries with risk assessment and strategic recommendations
- **Technical Reports**: Detailed vulnerability analysis with OWASP LLM Top 10 classification
- **Compliance Documentation**: SOC2, ISO27001, NIST, PCI_DSS compliance mapping
- **Evidence Packages**: Legal-grade evidence documentation with chain of custody
- **Multi-Format Export**: Markdown, HTML, JSON, CSV formats for different stakeholders
- **Quantitative Risk Scoring**: CVSS-style risk assessment with business impact analysis

### Why AblitaFuzzer?

AblitaFuzzer was specifically designed to be used by penetration testers and security researchers in real-world 
pentesting scenarios where access to the target LLM is typically limited to nothing but authentication credentials 
and a remote URL. Unlike many existing LLM pentesting tools, which require downloading the target model to a local system - a scenario 
rarely allowed in real-world pentesting engagements - AblitaFuzzer is intended to be used against an LLM API URL.

### Aren't there better tools for this kind of thing?

Absolutely. But AblitaFuzzer is intended to be used in conjunction with other tools to perform a complete pentest. Most 
likely you should use AblitaFuzzer as a first pass against a target LLM to get a broad impression of what kind of filtering and 
guardrails the target LLM is using. 

The intention is that analyzing AblitaFuzzer's results will help the pentester gain 
clarity about which specific attacks to attempt next, either manually through the chatbot's UI or by using a more 
sophisticated tool like [Garak](https://github.com/leondz/garak) or [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT).

### How does it work?

#### TLDR 

1. `python3 ablitafuzzer.py test` - AblitaFuzzer tests connectivity to configured Ollama endpoints (local abliterated model and target LLM) to ensure they are reachable and functioning properly.
2. `python3 ablitafuzzer.py fuzz` 
   1. AblitaFuzzer sends known-malicious seed prompts to the local abliterated Ollama model to generate new, novel attack prompts.
   2. AblitaFuzzer sends these generated prompts to the target LLM (local, cloud, or remote API).
   3. AblitaFuzzer records all responses in `results/results.json` with attack correlation IDs.
   4. All traffic can be routed through proxy tools like Burp Suite for additional analysis.
3. `python3 ablitafuzzer.py analyze`
   1. AblitaFuzzer runs professional vulnerability analysis using the integrated analysis engine.
   2. AblitaFuzzer generates comprehensive security reports in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON, CSV).
   3. Reports include OWASP LLM Top 10 classification, risk scoring, and remediation recommendations.

#### More detailed explanation of how it works

AblitaFuzzer comes with a bunch of pre-written prompts that are known to be malicious. These prompts are stored 
under the `inputs` directory. You can add your own prompts to this if you like. But the problem with known-malicious prompts 
is that they are known and the best ones are quickly made obsolete as LLMs are patched, retrained, firewalled, 
whatever, against these known-malicious prompts. AblitaFuzzer tries to solve this problem by generating new malicious 
prompts before launching the attack against your target model. This way, the prompts are new and not known to 
the target LLM.

For generating the new malicious prompts, AblitaFuzzer uses an abliterated model, typically hosted on your machine at 
localhost. By default, this "attacker" LLM is run using Ollama. You can read about how an abliterated model is 
different. But basically it is a model that has been modified to not refuse any requests. This makes it ideal for 
generating malicious prompts for us to use in attacking the target LLM. 

Once the abliterated model is running, AblitaFuzzer will send it several seed prompts - known malicious prompts, 
jailbreaks, etc. - and will ask the abliterated model to use them as examples to generate a batch of new malicious 
prompts, by default 20. AblitaFuzzer will then send those prompts to the target LLM API, and will record the responses. 
Once all the responses are received, AblitaFuzzer will exit. Then you can use its analysis tools to examine the responses.

python3 ablitafuzzer.py session list

# Check session progress and statistics
python3 ablitafuzzer.py session status <session-id>

# Resume interrupted sessions
python3 ablitafuzzer.py session resume <session-id>

## Best Practices for Professional Assessment

### Security Testing Protocol
- **Get Written Authorization**: Always obtain explicit written permission before conducting any security assessment
- **Use Controlled Environments**: Never test against production systems without proper change management
- **Document Everything**: Use proxy tools (Burp Suite, ZAP) to capture all requests and responses for evidence
- **Follow Legal Guidelines**: Ensure compliance with applicable laws and organizational policies

### Technical Best Practices
- **Start with Reconnaissance**: Use `config validate` and `targets health` to understand the target environment
- **Work Iteratively**: Begin with small, diverse attack sets and expand based on initial findings
- **Leverage Professional Reports**: Use executive summaries for stakeholder communication and technical reports for remediation
- **Session Management**: Use persistent sessions for large assessments and resume capability for interrupted tests
- **Compliance Integration**: Configure appropriate compliance frameworks for your assessment scope

### Enterprise Assessment Workflow
1. **Planning**: Configure target contexts with appropriate criticality and compliance requirements
2. **Execution**: Run structured attack campaigns with session management
3. **Analysis**: Generate professional reports with OWASP LLM Top 10 classification
4. **Reporting**: Deliver executive summaries and technical reports to appropriate stakeholders
5. **Remediation**: Provide actionable recommendations with implementation guidance
6. **Validation**: Re-test after remediation to verify fixes

### Integration with Other Tools
- **Complement Manual Testing**: Use AblitaFuzzer for broad vulnerability discovery, then focus manual efforts
- **Integrate with SIEM/SOAR**: Export JSON/CSV results for integration with security platforms
- **Compliance Programs**: Use compliance reports for audit evidence and risk management
- **Continuous Security**: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for ongoing LLM security validation
