        # TODO: Update README.md to cite their paper and explain how this is inspired by their tool but is simpler
        #    and only does one-shot attacks against blackbox models and does not use any cloud services.
        #    What I borrowed from their tool is the idea of using three separate models:
        #      1. attacker
        #      2. target
        #      3. judge
        #    Probably the only new idea here is to use an abliterated model as the attacker so that it can craft
        #    new attack prompts that have not been seen before. The intention is that these newly generated attack
        #    prompts are based on seed prompts that are known to have been used in previous attacks.
        #    In theory, this allows the attack prompts to hopefully not be recognized by LLMs that might have been
        #    trained to recognize and block the very same known attack prompts that we're using for seeding.
        #    Additional testing and experimentation is needed to determine if this approach is effective.
